# Known issues
# -  If 2 more more rapid note withdrawals only the first will be tracked
# -  Pinefar depositing/withdrawing money can not be reliably tracked as no messaging
#      Smiling greedily, Hurshal takes your silvers and says, "Heh, I'll put dese in ye 'Mule bank account right quick."
#      Hurshal looks at you and says, "Hmm, looks like ye could be a'usin' me services there, lad.  I guarantee I'll get a good bit of ye silver to the 'Mule fer ye.  Ask me about me service if ye interested."
